## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 3
I really liked this lab because it was just getting into actually coding, and it made it really fun. It was also a lot more simple to translate what was going on in the coding language into English, meaning that it didn't get too frustrating when I got stuck.

Lab 6, part 2
This lab stood out to me because I like blackjack and it was a familiar concept so it felt like I was solving a puzzle instead of an assignment. The way that the lab wanted us to reach the final answer was different than what I had originally thought of, so it opened my eyes to the fact that there are different ways to reach the same answer in coding, just ike math.

Lab 10
I personally liked this lab because it looked like a lot of work originally, but it turned out to be a little bit less than the rest of them. This was cool because it made the sense of acomplishment even better once it was finished. This lab also felt more like a puzzle to me once it was finished because it was shorter.
